# Variables Editor (Prototype)

## Build the sample extension

```bash
npm i
```

## Run the standalone editor

Run the editor by doing the following (VS code):

1. Press `F5` to open the standalone editor in chrome
2. Edit variable keys and values, delete lines via the tail icon (🗑️) and add new lines via the tail icon (➕). The value fields try to guess the value type (i.e. string, float, integer or boolean).
